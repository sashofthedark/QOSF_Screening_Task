    #define a list of probabilities for X error gate
    #define a list of probabilities for the Z error gate
    #define upper and lower qubits (as |0> and |+> states)
    #run the function which applies the noise and error correction and returns a list of Boolean results 
    #(True if error correction succeeded and False otherwise)
    #function parameters are initial states (upper and lower qubits), prob_X, prob_Z, and desired final state.
